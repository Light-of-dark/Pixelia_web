            <h2>Lore</h2>
            <h3>The Forbidden Legend of the Demon Lord</h3>
            <p>Long ago, the Demon Lord Akuma ruled over the dark dimension known as Oblivion's Rift. His essence was scattered across 10 forbidden gems, each holding a fragment of his soul. These were hidden in places beyond mortal reach.</p>
            <h3>The Cult of the Demon Lord and the Defeat of the Nine Kingdoms</h3>
            <p>The Cult of the Demon Lord, led by Grandmaster Malakar, sought these gems to resurrect Akuma. They conquered 9 great kingdoms, claiming the gems hidden within. The 10th gem, however, was hidden so well that it remained a mystery.</p>
            <h3>The Call to Arms: Adventurers Against the Cult</h3>
            <p>As the cult grew stronger, kingdoms sought heroes to stop them. The cultâ€™s stronghold was in the Land of the Demons, where they manipulated the local demon community. Adventurers, including you, invaded this land to thwart their plans.</p>
            <h3>The Invasion of the Demon Land</h3>
            <p>The cult had corrupted both the land and its inhabitants. Adventurers battled through demonic forces and cultists, seeking to prevent the cult from uncovering the final gem and completing their ritual.</p>
            <h3>The Betrayal of Akuma</h3>
            <p>The cult succeeded in finding the 10th gem and resurrecting Akuma. However, the Demon Lord betrayed them, killing the cult members and taking over the world.</p>
            <h3>The Final Battle</h3>
            <p>You, the last hope, must face Akuma. This final battle will determine the fate of Pixelia. Only by unlocking ancient powers can you hope to defeat the Demon Lord and end his reign.</p>
